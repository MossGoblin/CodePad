# CodePad
Loose ideas, small helpers, code snippets, etc.

== STUFF ==
* **Holographer** - trying to pack an array into an object (sort of)
* **Horizon** - start of a simple Unity game project - hex based exploration
* **Iterator** - convert iteration of a 2D array into a foreachable list (2xfor >> foreach)
* **MathPrimes** - library for using primes and related number theory math
* **RoomCompiler** - experiments with advanced object factories
* **Weighted Random Selector** - feed in a probability distribution or population in the form of an IEnumerable and get a random index in that IEnumerable, according to its values
  *  **Random** - gets a distribution (IEnumerable<double>) of positive values, treating each as a relative probability for selecting a random index from the IEnumerable
  * **RandomReverse** - same as above, but treating teh IEnumerable as a population that needs to be leveled - the higher teh value - the lower the chance of selecting its index
