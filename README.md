# CodePad
Loose ideas, small helpers, code snippets, etc.

== STUFF ==
* Holographer - trying to pack an array into an object (sort of)
* Horizon - start of a simple Unity game project - hex based exploration
* Iterator - convert iteration of a 2D array into a foreachable list
* Packer - same as Holographer, but simpler ( :) )
* MathPrimes - an attempt at a library for using primes and related number theory math
* RoomCompiler - experiments with advanced object factories

== TODO ==
* Weighted Random Selector - see RandomType from the Stack-n-Pack project
